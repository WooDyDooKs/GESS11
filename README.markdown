## General Introduction

As we travel by train regularly, we often experience commuters jamming into trains.
Based on the work of Philipp Heer & Lukas Bühler about Pedestrian Dynamics - Airplane
Evacuation Simulation we'd like to add the possibility of people entering a vehicle. In our case the vehicle will be a train. Our personal motivation to investigate further on this topic was that this phenomenom is annoying.

## Fundamental Questions

We'd like to investigate in what manner time needed to leave and enter the train depends on tendency of people to jam.
How does the time needed to leave and enter the train change with different levels of aggression? How does it change by defining distinct doors as exits or entries?

## Expected Results

We expect the time needed to leave the train to decrease when rules are obeyed.
