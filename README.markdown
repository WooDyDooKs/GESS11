Trail formation

### General Introduction

Knowing how pedestrians choose and form trails is important to develop means to guide them and lay out useful lanes. 


### Fundamental Questions

We would like to find answers to following questions:

How do obstacles (e.g. trees) influence trail formation? And thus, can pedestrians be guided by simply marking the trail with trees or is it necessary to highlight the intended track using gravel or other means?

Variables: how many times an agent passes a specific place (Where do the most “people” pass?). Could be measured using a counting loop for a number of areas.


### Expected Results

We expect people to be guided only be strongly marked trails and obstacles to have a minor influence on trail formation.


### References

We’d like to extend the model by adding a certain level of attraction towards existing trails we can establish randomly.


### Research Methods

We’re planning on using agent based modeling.
